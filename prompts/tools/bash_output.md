## `bash_output`

`bash_output(id, tail_lines?, max_chars?)`

Read output from a tracked background shell.

- Without `tail_lines`, returns unread output since the last `bash_output` call for that shell.
- With `tail_lines`, returns the recent tail without advancing the unread cursor.
- If output is truncated, prefer searching the full log file first and then reading the relevant region.
